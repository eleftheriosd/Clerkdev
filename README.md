# Welcome to My Clerks application!

In order to run the project on your localhost Server make sure to run `npm-install` in order to install neccesary dependencies, and then
`npm-start` in order to access the project at: `http://localhost:3000`.

Hope you enjoy the evaluation!

## Improvements that could take place:

- Could also add a disable/hide functionality on previous button if user is on page 0.
- Improve testing overall
- Improve responsiveness
- Add Animation on Card Swing
- Disable Card Swing on Desktop
- Include URL Param to restore User's State (current page)

## Points to highlight:

- Low prior experience in testing
- Applied different ways in tackling problems e.g. fetch vs async/await to illustrate knowledge of both
- Several comments are intentionally present in order to illustrate useful points.
- Focused more on clean code, good code structure & performance.

## Prior to Shipping to Production

- Would need to resolve CORS issue with the Api
